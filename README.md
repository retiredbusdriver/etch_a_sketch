This is a project where I will attempt to make a self generating grid. Through this grid I will make an "etch-a-sketch" like program where utilizing the cursor will leave a trail of softly blackened squares. The user will be able to specify how many squares they would like in the __x__ grid. The user may also turn on a mode where the RGB is randomized and is left instead of a continuously darkening black.
